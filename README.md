# mp3NoiseMachine
Arduino noise machine using DFRobot mini mp3 player

Mp3 files are loaded onto a microSD card and read by the mp3 player module. A potentiometer is used to control the volume and a button is used to change which noises
are being played. 

In the future an LED strip will be added to act as a night light and will pulse in a steady "breathing" pattern. Code will also be added to make the Arduino go into
deep sleep after a few hours of runtime.

printDetail void function was taken directly from DFRobot example code
